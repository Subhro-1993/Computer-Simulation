# Computer-Simulation

In this coursework, the given dataset have four types of data: scheduled arrival, unscheduled arrival, service scheduled and service unscheduled of police cars in a maintenance garage. We detected the distributions of the given dataset by using MS Excel and then made a simulation model for the given coursework, where the given two type of arrivals are happening andwe set the label priority for the unscheduled police car arrivals. For this the unscheduled police cars can interrupt the service of scheduled police cars and they were serviced before. We used a mechanic as a resource of the service area who will work in the garage for 8 hours per day and 7 days a week. We have used Simul8 software to make our simulation model and used some default labels of Simul8 to make our model work properly. After running the simulation model, we achieved 95% confidence interval for the utilisation of the resource of our model, i.e. mechanic.
